The bot requires a license file.


If you want to try the bot first, you can order a mini license.
It is very inexpensive ($5 per month) and is valid for three months.


All licenses are valid for a quarter of a year and include the operation of
of the bot, at least one strategy and the regular backtest (which already
offers much more than other bots).

For the regular license you can buy the Backtest Pro and get an increase of
speed so that you can perform around the factor 20 more tests cases in the
same time.

When a license expires, notices are sent to Telegram, the console and the log
file. The bot then only stops buying, the rest - i.e. selling and the exchange
to USDT in Bear Times - keeps on working.


As long as the beta phase is running, i.e. the bot does not yet have the
complete planned functionality of the version 1.0, prices are deliberately
kept low.

I reserve the right to raise the prices noticeably as soon as the currently
outstanding points such as GUI/web interface or trailing are implemented.


The threshold to use or try the bot should be low, therefore there are three
licenses of different sizes, each of them valid for one quarter.


Backtest Pro unchanged
- $20 for the quarter


One strategy (1 API key)

Unlimited Balance License
- costs are $17 per month, i.e. $51 for the entire quarter

Medium Balance License
- 35% discount on large license
- up to $2500 balance on the account
- costs are $11 per month, i.e. $33 for the entire quarter

Test license or license for small balances:
- 70% discount on large license
- up to $850 balance on the account
- costs are $5 per month, i.e. $15 for the entire quarter


Two strategies (2 API keys)

Unlimited Balance License
- 25% discount compared to two single licenses
- costs are $25 per month, i.e. $75 for the entire quarter

Medium Balance License
- 25% discount compared to two single licenses
- up to $2500 balance on the account
- costs are $16.67 per month, i.e. $50 for the entire quarter

Test license or license for small balances:
- 33% discount compared to two single licenses
- up to $850 balance on the account
- costs are $6.67 per month, i.e. $15 for the entire quarter



If the account balance exceeds the maximum value of the license, then
(as with the expiration of time) only the buying stops, the rest keeps
working. (Telegram, console and log messages indicate this.)
